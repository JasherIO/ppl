# Welcome to Pulsar Weeklies!

## All the information you need to know



## When:



On **October 23rd, 2018**, we will re-launch our weekly tournaments for the Rocket League community. Top players from all around North America can compete for their chance to show off their skills and take home the prize. 



## What we do:

Focusing on statistics is one of our key goals, keeping track of what how your team does and how you compare to the rest of the community will be great to show improvement and team progression. How many goals does my team score on average? How many times has the roster changed? How many tournaments have I played in? What is my win percentage against this team? We will have the answers to all of these and more!



## Prize:

Pulsar Weeklies will start off with a $30 prize pool given to the winner of the event.
