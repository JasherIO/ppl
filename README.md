# Pulsar Premier League

This [site](https://pulsarpremierleague.com) is built with [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org). The starter template can be found [here](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms).

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.

## Prerequisites

- Node (v8.2.0+ Recommeded)
- [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)

### Access Locally
```
$ git clone https://github.com/[GITHUB_USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME].git
$ cd [REPO_NAME]
$ yarn
$ npm run develop
```
To test the CMS locally, you'll need run a production build of the site:
```
$ npm run build
$ npm run serve
```

## Debugging
Windows users might encounter ```node-gyp``` errors when trying to npm install.
To resolve, make sure that you have both Python 2.7 and the Visual C++ build environment installed.
```
npm config set python python2.7
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```
